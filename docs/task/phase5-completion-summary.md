## Outstanding Items

### Tasks Not Completed
The following tasks were not completed as they require manual execution:

- **Task 7:** Create MVP manual verification checklist
  - Status: Not started
  - Reason: Requires manual test case design and user workflow validation
  
- **Task 8:** Execute manual verification and record results
  - Status: Not started
  - Reason: Depends on Task 7 completion and requires manual testing

### Recommendations for Manual Testing
When ready to complete manual verification:

1. **Create checklist** covering:
   - Project management (create, save, open, delete)
   - Node operations (create, edit, drag, copy, delete)
   - Edge operations (connect, cycle detection, delete)
   - Execution flow (run, stop, parallel, error handling)
   - Persistence (save, restore, export, import)
   - Accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)
   - Browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

2. **Execute verification** with:
   - Clean browser environment
   - Test data prepared (API keys, prompts)
   - Screenshot key steps
   - Document issues with severity levels

3. **Track issues** using format:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Screenshots/logs

## Key Achievements

1. **Exceeded all coverage targets** - All metrics above 80% threshold
2. **Fast test execution** - Full suite runs in ~1 second
3. **Comprehensive test utilities** - Reusable mocks and helpers
4. **100% test pass rate** - No flaky or failing tests
5. **Well-documented** - Clear testing guide for team members

## Technical Highlights

### Test Utilities
Created robust test utilities that simplify test writing:
- `createMockNode()` - Generate test nodes with sensible defaults
- `createMockEdge()` - Generate test edges
- `createMockProjectSnapshot()` - Generate complete project snapshots
- `createMockMessage()` - Generate chat messages

### Mock Data
Comprehensive mock data covering common scenarios:
- Empty nodes, nodes with messages, error nodes
- Simple edges, cyclic edges, complex graphs
- Various node types (input, response, hybrid)

### Test Organization
Clean test structure following best practices:
- Co-located with source files
- Descriptive test names
- AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- Focused on behavior, not implementation

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Verification** (Tasks 7-8)
   - Design and execute manual test checklist
   - Document any issues found
   - Create issue tracking list if needed

2. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Add test execution to CI pipeline
   - Set up coverage reporting
   - Configure test failure blocking

3. **Expand Coverage** (Future)
   - Add component tests for UI elements
   - Add integration tests for workflows
   - Add E2E tests for critical paths

## Conclusion

Phase 5 successfully established a solid testing foundation for the Canvas MVP. All automated testing objectives were met or exceeded, with comprehensive coverage of core business logic. The test suite is fast, reliable, and well-documented, providing confidence for future development.

The project is now ready for manual verification (Tasks 7-8) to complete the quality gates milestone.
